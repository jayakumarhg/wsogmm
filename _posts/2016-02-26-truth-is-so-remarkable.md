Richard Feynman in “[Curiosity][1]”, part of [The Feynman Series][2], explaining the charm of physics and science in general:

> It’s curiosity, as to where we are, what we are. It’s very much more exciting to discover that we’re on a ball, half of us sticking upside down, it’s spinning around in space, there’s a mysterious force which holds us on, going around a great big blob of gas that’s burning, by a fire that’s completely different from any fire …
> 
> … the **truth is so much more remarkable**. The pleasure of physics to me, is that it’s revealed the truth is so remarkable …

Gives goose bumps every time I hear Feynman’s enthusiastic intonation set to wonderful music.
