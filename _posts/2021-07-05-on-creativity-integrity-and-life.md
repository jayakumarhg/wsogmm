Bill Watterson, creator of the beloved [Calvin and Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes) comic strip, in his thought provoking [speech](http://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/C-H-speech.html) at Kenyon College graduation commencement, gives his insightful perspective on

*creativity*
> We're not really taught how to recreate constructively. We need to do more than find diversions; we need to restore and expand ourselves. Our idea of relaxing is all too often to plop down in front of the television set and let its pandering idiocy liquefy our brains. Shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating; the mind is like a car battery-it recharges by running.

*integrity*
> You will find your own ethical dilemmas in all parts of your lives, both personal and professional. We all have different desires and needs, but if we don't discover what we want from ourselves and what we stand for, we will live passively and unfulfilled. Sooner or later, we are all asked to compromise ourselves and the things we care about. We define ourselves by our actions. With each decision, we tell ourselves and the world who we are. Think about what you want out of this life, and recognize that there are many kinds of success.

and finally *life*
> Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it's to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of successâ€¦. 
> To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble.
