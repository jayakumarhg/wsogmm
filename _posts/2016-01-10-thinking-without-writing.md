“If you are thinking without writing, you only _think_ you are thinking.” says
Lessie Lamport in [Thinking for Programmers][1] talk. Having always wanted to
maintain a blog, this got me thinking about writing regularly.

#### Consuming without Thinking 
Personally, my default activity on weekends has become binge consumption of
content: web articles, tv shows, movies and sometimes books. They continue to be
enjoyable. But after a few days, I would barely recall the data mentioned in a
news report, or the plot-twists of a movie or the experimental results of a
study. Without taking time to reflect, it has all become a blur. 

This seems to be a global phenomenon. The rate of media consumption is
increasing. US media consumption rate rose from 11 hours per day per person in
2008 to 15 hours in 2015, according to a [study][2] by UC San Diego. As
explained in the study, if we are consuming 15 hours worth of media per day, it
only means that we are multi-tasking and not paying attention, resulting in
lower comprehension.

#### Thinking through Writing
Writing could provide the time to reflect and assimilate. I have been toying
with this idea for two years. But I have been avoided writing by rationalising
not knowing the topic, audience or purpose. I also feel into the perfection
trap, trying to figure out the perfect platform, the perfect content, forgetting
that “[perfect is the enemy of good][3]”. So, this blog is a personal attempt to
take time to think through writing.
